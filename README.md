# Trail - Increase your sales!

## About The Project
**Trail** is a project which is going to help increase the sell, is escpecially addressed to blogers who sell own products. **I created only frontend side of this project for now.** You can see frontend but you can`t use my tool in real life to increase your sell, there is no real backend, no engine colecting and processing data.

**Trail** it is a demo project with dummy data.

## From problems to the idea

### How the idea to create Trail came up?
I worked in marketing and it was very hard to find a tool to track only converted users. Imgaine that you run a blog and sell there some products such as books, online tutorials and so on. Every day you sell some products and you want to increase your sell results. 
In order to do that you want to know evertyhing about people, who already bought some your products. I would like to especially know which article and pages on my blog convinced users to buy my products. I would like to have a full paying user`s path from first visit untill the sell on my blog.

Knowing that I can see which pages I should promote more than other.

### Real problems:
- **First problem** -
Theoretically I can use Google Analytics or similar tools to do that, but in practice there is no easy way to set up google analitcis to track only paying users. You have to have technical knowledge to set up a tool to be working that way.

- **Second problem** - 
Next big problems are cookies and tracking people between different domains. Blogers use most often blog only to create articles, but selling pages are usally placed on diffrent domains and subdomains. Without specific knowledge about Cookies, CORS, it is almost impossible to properly configure cookies to be able to track customers everywhere on your sites with tools like Google Analytics, Yandex Metrica and so on.

I met these problems and I would love to have a tool like this. The tool which can show full paths of converted users, working between domains and subdomains with easy and understanable configuration adjusted to non-technical peoples.
